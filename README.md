Oil Futures

In this post I want to outline the key points regarding the situation on the market.

Let's start with the fact that the price of Oil is not negative. Futures prices on Oil are negative and only during May. In the graphs below I showed the current price of WTI and Futures Price of WTI that are negative in May and are positive afterwards.

Why Futures on Oil are negative? Theoretically, Future Prices cannot go negative. So, why Oil producers (those who sell Futures contract mainly to hedge their revenues) are willing to pay buyers to get rid of the oil? Oil producers don't posses limitless storage spaces and it may be quite expensive to just stop producing oil (stopping oil extraction is not a press-one-button-to-stop-extracting process)

The good news are that after May the Oil Futures are traded at positive prices and growing up in the future. What it may tell us? It may be that the market expects that by June the demand for fuel and Oil will be back and that the economy will start its recovery.
